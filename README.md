Description:
A simple 2D shooting game built with Python and Pygame. The player controls a ship on the left side of the screen, moving it up and down while shooting bullets at a moving rectangle target on the right. The goal is to hit the target before the bullets miss three times.

Key Features:

Moving ship and target

Bullet shooting with collision detection

Miss counter and game over logic

Clean, modular code with separate classes for Ship, Bullet, Rectangle, Button, and Game Stats

Tech:
Python Â· Pygame Â· OOP Â· Sprite Groups Â· Game Loops
